# Parkinsons-Disease-Prediction-Model

This dataset is composed of a range of biomedical voice measurements from
31 people, 23 with Parkinson's disease (PD). Each column in the table is a
particular voice measure, and each row corresponds one of 195 voice
recording from these individuals ("name" column). The main aim of the data
is to discriminate healthy people from those with PD, according to "status"
column which is set to 0 for healthy and 1 for PD.
